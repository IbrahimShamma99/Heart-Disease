    "Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"heart disease\" is often used interchangeably with the term \"cardiovascular disease.\" Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Diagnosis**: The diagnosis of heart disease is done on a combination of clinical signs and test results. The types of tests run will be chosen on the basis of what the physician thinks is going on [1](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353124), ranging from electrocardiograms and cardiac computerized tomography (CT) scans, to blood tests and exercise stress tests [2](https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/your-heart/living-with-heart-disease/medical-tests).\n",

    "Looking at information of heart disease risk factors led me to the following: **high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, weight, family history and smoking** [3](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/risk-factors). According to another source [4](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/understand-your-risks-to-prevent-a-heart-attack), the major factors that can't be changed are: **increasing age, male gender and heredity**. Note that **thalassemia**, one of the variables in this dataset, is heredity. Major factors that can be modified are: **Smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, physical inactivity, and being overweight and having diabetes**. Other factors include **stress, alcohol and poor diet/nutrition**.\n",

    "I can see no reference to the 'number of major vessels', but given that the definition of heart disease is **\"...what happens when your heart's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries\"**, it seems logical the *more* major vessels is a good thing, and therefore will reduce the probability of heart disease.\n",
